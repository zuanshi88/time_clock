06/08 07:16: Happy to report, the exit route worked.  If I get a chance to chat with Micah about this program i should as him about that. Weird, no?
06/08 07:16: Ended up trying the &quot;Exit&quot; route here.
06/08 07:13: Did this plug my leaky hole?
06/08 07:09: I have a desire to build things and to use my mind... there is nothing wrong with that.
06/08 07:02: start some kind of website
06/07 22:22: This is how an idea comes together
06/07 22:19: this is also a test
06/07 22:19: This is a test
06/07 22:12: We did it again!
06/07 22:12: Okay... we did it!
06/07 22:09: Did that do if!?!
06/07 22:09:  06/07 22:04: Is the idea file working?
06/07 16:56:
06/07 16:55:
06/07 15:27: Hopefully polishing up this code and generalizing it a bit will get me to a new plateau
06/07 10:44:  06/07 10:21:  06/07 09:07:  06/07 08:32: What is my hesitation with using the term studying?  I am studying!!! And it is wonderful!

06/07 07:02: Do I need to get a MacBook?
06/07 06:51: RESEARCH TOPIC- alternative file saving display structures (the back end wouldn&#39;t really have to be much different than it is now... perhaps just a bit more hyperlinked, but that&#39;s probably okay because of the speed of our processors, no?
06/07 06:41: APP IDEA: TOPIC- It literally organizes your thoughts for you. Suggests a few basic file organizing structures.  And secure saving and accessibility options.  Primmary for tablets. This could be the base of the mind mapping idea I had a few years ago. This could just be a file managing system.  Very basic.  Central hub. Touched (button can be set to differnt sound, visual/tactile interaction levels) central hub reveals spoking out sub hubs which can then be touched to reveal their subhubs.  From within each hub and subhub the user would have the ability to create and store and array of document types and weblinks. Ideal for kids and senior to easier access key documents, programs, projects and media storage.
06/07 06:38: nd the Low Saddle Pass has me thinking of the Southwest and dry air and scrub soil. And a gushing roar on up ahead.
06/07 06:38: But the wait between the first and last, is muc less Grand than the Low Saddle Pass.
06/07 06:37: There is a repetition to the pause between the lines.
06/07 06:37: There is kind of a great level of privacy with typing this way.
06/06 15:44: File under &quot;k&quot;... still going to ideas, but changed &quot;else&quot; in code conditional to &quot;String&quot; from return.
06/06 15:40: File under &#39;n&#39;: inputing &#39;n&#39; got me to ideas which is assigned to 0
06/06 15:37: Does this go to zero because it has no meaning? If this does go to ideas that is really fascination... unless, did I code ideas as &quot;else&quot;?
06/06 15:36: 3
06/05 21:54: Let&#39;s make banana bread in the morning.
06/05 16:48: Is there such a thing as a self_hating narcissist?
06/05 16:47: Maybe I&#39;m what&#39;s wrong with American.</pre>
