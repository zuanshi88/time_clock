<p>06/09 21:40: Slow the fuck down on the weed intake, eh?</p>

<pre>06/09 08:31: Or at least take the time to make the experiment with a reasonable fall back plan if the momentum shifted.
06/09 08:31: Forego bootcamp?
06/09 08:29: @ 133 momentum grows, anticaption of learning and growth inspires.  
06/09 08:28: Okay, that didn&#39;t work, but I feel like I have taken another good step forward
06/09 08:26: /t Can I escape characters in this journal? /n That would be really fucking awesome if I could!/n
06/08 14:34: I have a new JavaScript book and I am feeling fond of the future.
06/08 14:32: Note from 5/29/2020- Stoned, out of work, sunny day, fresh coffee, baby napping. Wife daughter on-line preschool
06/08 14:13: Thinking about about using log for everything else and IDEAS just for Tech related topics.
06/08 12:53: Worked on some Ruby with Boris and then did some contact management. Also Certified
06/08 11:57: Certified the previous two weeks.  My next certification date will be the 22nd
06/08 10:24: Spent the morning thus far researching technologies and beginning my big Excel glossary. Not smoking today and I feel good.
06/08 06:59: Waking up today to finally getting on the ides trajectory.  Humble yourself. Love.
06/07 22:10: This seems to have finished it up!! Refactor complete?
06/07 22:05: This shit is getting ridiculous...
06/07 21:50: This is another useless log just to make sure this program is running as it should be
06/07 21:39: Good... we are on the home stretch now!
06/07 21:33: The refactoring of this program is getting a bit old, but I think totally worth it.  Its much more programmy after this integration.  
06/07 17:54: Is this working again.  I just reconfigured some of the code to generalize the files that I am using to save the date.
06/07 15:27: Just checking to see if the other options are functioning?
06/06 15:52: Chuckling to myself on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in which I am working on purpose... inside. The Birkey&#39;s, including Aunt Linda visited from late-morning to early afternoon.  Helena charmed and cuddled. Esme chatted, sang Karaoke, and regaled. Arlan and I did a Jimmy&#39;s Pizza Cafe run with our masks on for business.  Just a gorgeous day.  The big front tree breezes in towards the window in all her June new leaf splendor.  
06/06 06:48: Something is off with the in_and_out file.  The rest of the program seems to be working well though.  The birkey&#39;s are een route from Ft. Wayne for a day visit.  They are bringing the crib with them
06/05 22:00: The night falls soft around us.  And we breath the air of the fallen angels. Buddhist monks in priestly garb breath languidly in the night.  Forsooth my harold of ivory.  My Bandicoot wench.  My sly pantry mouse. My marigold splint. 
06/05 16:26: Logged out and then logged right back in because I feel like I can justify taking credit for the time that I wasn&#39;t just programming based on the fact that I did some reading last night in the PM that I didn&#39;t record. I&#39;ll be liberal on this front, but the most important this is ridiculous numbers.  If your numbers are ridiculous then you must be doing something right... even if they are a little padded here and there... 
06/05 15:21: So where are we exactly?  I don&#39;t know.  I think it is a good place, though I haven&#39;t explored every nook and crany of this place.  I haven&#39;t lived all the way through this moment.  I like the aesthetics of this page.  I like the black space and seeing words emerge on a screen white against the darkness.
06/05 08:30: This shit is getting crazy!!
06/05 08:13: This seems to be working.  Very pleased with how the refactoring of this program is going.  It seems silly to be spendin so much time on it, but it feels important since it is giving me a really practical, tangible project to apply the concepts that I am learning.
06/05 07:15: Okay, maybe it hasn&#39;t saved yet or something... or wait... no, I think that is right, I just have it wrong on the menu hhere.
06/05 07:11: Interesting... something was going wrong with the all else option there.  It was returning to OUT for the catch all character design and I was unable to access LOG.  After swapping the switches of these two functions though I have been able to access LOG through the &quot;6&quot; swtich.  Why is the catchall piping to OUT? though.  OUT is set to the 0 switch...
16:01:  15:47:  15:26:  06/04 08:54:  06/04 08:53:  06/04 08:40: This should be the same path set up, but with differnt formating on some of the input.
06/04 08:39:  08:35: I haven&#39;t noticed if the formating is substantially different since I changed the method of adding the new text as a string concatenation move as opposed to an Array .unshift.
08:31:  08:31:  08:27:  07:47:  07:16: &quot;Surfer&#39;s Hymn&quot; PandaBear is hitting just right right now.
07:01: combating digital dislocation...suffering through the shit the follows the wanton feast.
06:47: But with more features. I should make a module for the redirecting of IO to the beginning of the array.  I should look at that again.  I feel like up to this point that is some of the best coding that I have done.  I would definitely look forward to more such moments.  
06:46: THe command prompt control panel... it must exist.  I&#39;m imagining something very similar to Journal 2000.  
16:36: Worked on Ruby Koans... found some PHP koans...Thought about making a MADLIB game for Esme, Want to consolodate address books, keep getting better at looking into settings and configurations.  I am the configurator.  
15:27: Definitely getting into it!
15:25: That is a pretty cool sequence of keyboard short cuts.  It feels good to be getting into files with such ease and confidence.  I like this environment.  My white journal is kind of sober... There is something calming about the black backgorand the white font.  It may help that I had a quarter brownie
15:25: this is suppose to the a special day
15:24: Just jump into a topic.  Try to get somewhere in 10-15 minutes and if you gain traction- fantastic, if not, move on 
12:57: Thinking about more functionalities to add.  Also could do something with the interface.  
12:53: Made another declaration to betsy regarding my enthusiasm for coding.  I need to fucking do the work now.  
11:16: I&#39;ll admit that is a little bit dramatic. But what if this was the way to embrace the cliche of taking the risk to make an opportunity ... I&#39;d like to think it is.
11:15: So here we are at the beginning of another coding session.  We had a somewhat productive morning- up early for a morning session.  Am I a psychotic person for just digging in and focusing on my career right now while the city burns all arouaround 
15:31:  15:22:  15:20:  15:16: Thus far today: log_book_3000 is up and running, Boris up to 247/260 (nearly finished!), looked into local coding schools
11:38: Are my controls still accurate?
11:32: Wanted to see if I took care of that goddamned n/character that I erroneously added.</pre>

<p>11:32: Wanted to see the log 11:30: I wonder if I could really make money doing this!! /n11:30: This is the life, man! /n11:30: Have to add a few more just to be sure! /n11:29:  /n11:28: Holy Shit… did I do it!?!… What did I just do to make this work??? /n11:27: This is the test… I had those two files open and that was doing something that I don&#39;t totally understand /nThis is WHAT happens now!! /n2020-05-28 08:18:51 -0500 Now can I do it? 2020-05-28 08:19:22 -0500 it didn&#39;t print the time, how odd? 2020-05-28 08:21:08 -0500 How whas that? 2020-05-28 08:21:24 -0500 Huh? that actially dod it! 2020-05-28 17:53:58 -0500 need to change the settings to always be administator view 2020-05-28 17:54:30 -0500 I should do some review of the time object in Ruby 2020-05-28 18:05:31 -0500 put Make Stack in my Stack 2020-05-28 18:06:42 -0500 make the object in another file!!!!! 2020-05-29 05:11:57 -0500 Up early and getting in a groove with this computer thing.  My the eloqunece of the morning. 2020-05-29 05:13:35 -0500 This style of work and these tools are totally my speed. 2020-05-29 05:13:54 -0500 I believe my ego has stood in my way of learning them earlier. 2020-05-29 10:22:24 -0500 Now I have it in place.  I keep running into these little issues and then working to fix them… Are these issues finally fixed? 2020-05-29 10:52:00 -0500 Fuck!Fuck!Fuck! This is like a minor existential crisis not being able to run atom… 2020-05-29 10:52:16 -0500 going to try to re-download atom 2020-05-29 11:47:59 -0500 This is fucking bullshit!! 2020-05-29 11:48:15 -0500 What the fuck can&#39;t I get this back on track!! 2020-05-29 12:19:16 -0500 Breaking off for lunch… try to pull together today&#39;s numbers… this not being able to run ruby is killing me!! 2020-05-29 13:29:23 -0500 BACK IN FUCKING BUSINESS!! Did not have the runner extension downloaded… did not know I needed that!  That makes sense now though.. 2020-05-29 14:33:06 -0500 It feels really good to have things running again and to have overcome the obstacles that were standing in my way. 2020-05-29 14:33:23 -0500 I am gaining confidence from these forays into coding.  2020-05-29 14:34:11 -0500 working on FILE reading and writing while working on das_stack.</p>

<p>2020-05-29 14:37:03 -0500 here we go 2020-05-29 14:37:32 -0500</p>

<p>2020-05-29 14:37:39 -0500 this is it! 2020-05-29 16:15:02 -0500 I need to look at more code!! 2020-05-30 08:12:49 -0500 Back at it.  LEt&#39;s get a program that remembers itself. 2020-05-30 09:33:38 -0500 Interesting..its a Nil class… well, yeah, cause its nil! 2020-05-30 09:34:04 -0500 Kind of excited to run the methods method on the NilClass.  2020-05-30 11:12:13 -0500 Working on da_stack- still have the same issue of saving state at the end of the program run.  Beginning to see why “threads” and “state” are important.</p>

<p>2020-05-30 11:12:22 -0500 I like the nitty gritty. Sat May 30 16:30:58 2020 Really good session… just logged in two really good consecutive hours. putting me at 5 and a quarter hours Sun May 31 07:14:01 2020 Jus tried Atom and it wasn&#39;t running again. Sun May 31 07:14:54 2020 thought I had that issue behind me.  Collected myself. Made sure that ruby was still on the computer.  Could it be a path thing. Sun May 31 07:15:58 2020 Maybe its runner.  Mayber I shouldn&#39;t even work through runner as much as I do.  run my tests through command prompt and right clean sure code.</p>
