 06/07 06:51: RESEARCH TOPIC- alternative file saving display structures (the back end wouldn't really have to be much different than it is now... perhaps just a bit more hyperlinked, but that's probably okay because of the speed of our processors, no?
 06/07 06:41: APP IDEA: TOPIC- It literally organizes your thoughts for you. Suggests a few basic file organizing structures.  And secure saving and accessibility options.  Primmary for tablets. This could be the base of the mind mapping idea I had a few years ago. This could just be a file managing system.  Very basic.  Central hub. Touched (button can be set to differnt sound, visual/tactile interaction levels) central hub reveals spoking out sub hubs which can then be touched to reveal their subhubs.  From within each hub and subhub the user would have the ability to create and store and array of document types and weblinks. Ideal for kids and senior to easier access key documents, programs, projects and media storage.
